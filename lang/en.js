Long time ago, in a galaxy far far away... a console was standing at the edge of the galaxy, and inside the console was the Backend Ctiy. Old Bit and Little Bit were living in the City ordinarily.
However, this day was an unusual day......

In the morning, Old Bit took Little Bit to the breakfast shop at the gate to buy breakfast. Suddenly, they heard a mechanical sound from the sky. They looked up, and found that someone came to the website!
The website they were in was a small blog, and usually no one visits it, but a strange guest came strangely today.
He dressed in black all over, with a pair of black sunglasses on the bridge of the nose.

"Why is this guy dressed in that way?" "Such a weird guest!" "I really don't know why he's here" ....

Bits on the street whispered to each other, and talked about that black guy.
    
Little Bit started to realize that something was wrong. As usual, the guests are the blogger's friends, classmates or family menbers, but this guest who came this time refused to show he's true face. It was quite suspicious!
    
Then, a giant code monster drilled out from the mechanical sound. It roared, and started to destroy the whole Backend City!!
Originally, the monster was summoned by the black guest. It had pointed horns on its head, two fangs gleamed with cold light, murderous looked in a pair of eyes, the sky was filled with breath of the death.
   
"ahhhhhhhh!!....."
A people on the street suddenly been catched by the mob, his body was torn in half by the teeth of it, the console started to put thousands of warnings:
`,
    "text.plot2": "Hacker!! the backend is been Invading!!!",
    "text.plot3": "Then, more and more bits were missing",
    "text.plot4": "A few years later, the originally prosperous Backend City became dirty and stench...",
    "text.plot5": `
The super code mob dead, the Backend City returned to the prosperous scene.
Yes, you saved the whole Backend City!!

The bits in the city are cheering, dancing and celebrating your victory.
But the hacker in the sky says: "Shit! I'll come back next time!"

......

    "text.plot6": "The super code mob appears in the front of you, you hold the %s tightly. At this moment, you're full of determination!!",
